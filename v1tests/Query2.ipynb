    "In this notebook, the question \"and have both genomic and and proteomic data\" is asked as \"and have data in both the genomic and proteomic data commons\". That is a useful thing to do in testing CDA as it represents a true aggregation use case across CRDC nodes. However, we should not lose sight of the fact that the query examples here are not expressed in terms of the type of data being queried. Cases already exist in CRDC where data of a given type are present in more than one node See [related workbook](./Query2%20by%20datatype.ipynb) for an exploration of that. That point made, on with the examples that query according to the node in which data resides.\n",
